- [ ] Implement virtual window selection and scrolling
- [ ] Defer border application until rendering and leave window buffer untouched
- [ ] Add border to window builder
- [ ] Implement window internal padding logic - reusable padding struct to hold internally?
- [ ] Ponder how deep the responsibility of state management should go in this library
  - Does it make sense to store menus and answer values logically instead of as raw character data?
- [ ] Add a mechanism for filters on windows (i.e. fog of war, tinting an entire window)
- [ ] Add a concept of temporary animated windows
  - Too far? It could be neat for particle effect kindda stuff
