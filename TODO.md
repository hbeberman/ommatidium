- [x] Implement virtual window selection and scrolling
- [x] Defer border application until rendering and leave window buffer untouched
- [x] Add border to window builder
- [x] Implement window internal padding logic - reusable padding struct to hold internally?
- [ ] Ponder how deep the responsibility of state management should go in this library
  - Does it make sense to store menus and answer values logically instead of as raw character data?
- [ ] Add a mechanism for filters on windows
  - Fog of War
  - Tinting
  - Alpha Masking
- [ ] Add a concept of temporary animated windows
  - Too far? It could be neat for particle effect kindda stuff
- [x] Revisit how we're storing Windows, is hierarchical traversal fine or would we be better served by a singular session owned vec and a list child indexes? Session owned vec is cleaner.
- [ ] Add a way for ommatidium to blit its own debug log as a topmost window
- [ ] Add a "fit" window type that will just be the actual physical dimensions of the terminal
- [ ] Figure out a way to run closures or functions on all descendants of a node
- [ ] Add a window type that renders a body of text with wordwrap
- [ ] Add a window type that is an input field with an indicator that it's selected
- [ ] Add a window prevalidator that warns against invalid conditions in a window/session that creep in when we let users manipulate the window structures themselves
- [x] Add color support!
- [ ] Add a concept of color shaders on characters
 - temporal,
 - positional (place X on screen, place X within string (animated rainbow text?))
 - status (poisoned?, bleeding?, wounded?)
 - could use this extensively
- [ ] Add delta rendering to just render characters that have changed
- [ ] Add continuation detection to delta rendering to avoid unnecessary cursor and color sets
